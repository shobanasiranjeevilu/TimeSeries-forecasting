# TimeSeries-forecasting
The main Objective of this project is to employ Machine Learning models to locate the incorrect sensor data and understand the anomalies. 
As a following step, we put in place a proactive anomaly detection system, which deals with the issue of anticipating anomalies before they occur. 
So, the goal is to issue accurate and timely alerts about interesting but rare events requiring action.
